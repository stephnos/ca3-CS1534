Its important to note that when previewing the website on codio, the only way ive got it to work 100% is by previewing the index.html file itself. Sometimes when I would click preview website at the top, it would work but without the CSS, which ruins the whole thing.

My home town was san francisco, I designed it with many pictures of the city, i used random colors for the background to keep it engaging. I used a navbar at the top which allows you to quickly tab between pages. The main challenge I faced was getting codio to work with github, but now that i've figured it out i'll never make it again. I used the bootstrap studio library to help me make the buttons navbar in CSS, it made it much quicker and efficient.
